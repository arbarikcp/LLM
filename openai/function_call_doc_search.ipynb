We test MIPS on a\\nbenchmark of 62 algorithmic tasks that can be learned by an RNN and find it\\nhighly complementary to GPT-4: MIPS solves 32 of them, including 13 that are\\nnot solved by GPT-4 (which also solves 30). MIPS uses an integer autoencoder to\\nconvert the RNN into a finite state machine, then applies Boolean or integer\\nsymbolic regression to capture the learned algorithm. As opposed to large\\nlanguage models, this program synthesis technique makes no use of (and is\\ntherefore not limited by) human training data such as algorithms and code from\\nGitHub. We discuss opportunities and challenges for scaling up this approach to\\nmake machine-learned models more interpretable and trustworthy.',\n",
